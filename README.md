# AfK-Farm-Bot
Bot/script for Playerunknown Battlegrounds (PUBG) that AFK farms battlepoints(bp)


# The bot no longer works as of April 2018. I rolled back the repo to my last commmit and I am archiving the repo since no further changes will be made. It was a fun ride and I hope everyone got a lot of BP out of it.

I plan on going back and adding doc strings/comments explaining each function/class
